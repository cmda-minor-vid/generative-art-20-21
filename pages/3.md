# 3. Input and Interaction

_We'll add interaction to your artwork based on variable input._

## Description

In the first part of the lesson we'll look at how to make your artwork respond to input. From a user or external source. The other half of the lesson is reserved for 'coaching' and feedback. You can book a spot and get some individual feedback on your work so far.

## Assignment

Make your artwork respond to input! This input can be from a user (gestures, clicks etc.) but can also be an external source like images, audio, sensor data etc. Most 'events' are build into P5.js so have a look at the documentation for inspiration. For other sources like music there are many additional libraries and plugins available.
