## 5/6. Work on your Artwork

_No new theory is introduced. You can continue working on your artwork._

## Description

We'll use lessons for questions and additional explanation. Lessons are _demand-driven_ so come prepared and know which questions you'll want to ask or what parts you'll want feedback on.

## Assignment

Continue working on your artwork for the final assessment. If you need feedback or need some inspiration to work on further don't hesistate to contact your teacher for advice.
