# 2. Randomization and Algorithms

_We'll cover the basics of algorithms and physics and randomness using built-in variables and conditionals._

## Description

In the first lesson we'll look at built-in variables and conditionals. How does your program makes choices and how do we get a different output each time it runs? In the second lesson we take that a step further and look at some more 'advanced algorithms'. Maybe even try out some physics and distributions.

## Assignment

Implement some degree of randomness to your artwork. Make sure it has different variables that change and generate a different output each time your program is run. Try to code a simple algorithm that your artwork uses for it's creation based on variable input.
