# 1. Basics of Generative Art

_We'll cover the basics of what generative art is and introduce processing._

## Description

In the first lesson we talk about what generative art is. I'll demonstrate some of the basic concepts and give you examples. We'll talk about randomness, generativity and algorithms. In the second lesson we'll explore the basics of P5.js. How it works, how you read the documentation and how to implement plugins and libraries.

## Assignment

Read some of the resources to understand what generative art and processing are. Look for inspiration and think about your concept and document your research in the `readme.md` of your GitHub repository. Get comfortable with how P5.js works and start out coding your concept!
